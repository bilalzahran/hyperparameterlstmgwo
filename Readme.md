# LSTMGWO
This repository provide a code for accepted paper at The 3rd International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA) entitled "Hyperparameter Setting of LSTM-based Language Model Using Grey Wolf Optimizer". 

# Usage
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the GWO to find the best hyperparamater of LSTM using 25% of dataset and will train and test the LSTM with 100% of dataset.
